# Virtual-Desktop
This is a Simple Virtual OS/Desktop using GO Language and Fyne(Framework or GUI Toolkit). In this, I have added 4 Software or Utility-App (Gallery, Calculator, Text-Editor & Weather Reporter).
In Calculator, you can simple use All basic BODMAS Function. In Text-Editor, you can simply create a new and save file in local strorage and open them easily.
Same in Weather-App, you can see Weather-Info of your Local which I have settled using APIs.

Hope You Like This.
